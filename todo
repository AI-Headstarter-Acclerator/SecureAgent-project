ERROR in suggestions:
6. In `src/constants.ts`, the `processGitFilepath` function removes the leading '/' from the filepath. However, it doesn't handle the case where the filepath is null or undefined. Consider adding error handling for this case.
7. In `src/prompts/code-prompt.ts`, the `getTaskBreakdownPrompt` and `getCodeAgentPrompt` functions return an array of `ChatMessage`. However, there's no error handling if the input parameters are null or undefined. Consider adding error handling for these cases.

Coder Agent

break original goal into tasks
- accomplish list of tasks
Determine when goal is achieved

Need to be able to self determine when task is done, should not be limited to 5 steps!

move to next step after editing a file

the edit function should insert NOT overwrite (this causes too many issues).
Does not take into account full context of the files, need to figure this out

relevantTask is not accurate (remove?)


how to determine when a task is achieved
- a task may take multiple steps

testing:
