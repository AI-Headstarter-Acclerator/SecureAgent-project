ERROR in suggestions:
6. In `src/constants.ts`, the `processGitFilepath` function removes the leading '/' from the filepath. However, it doesn't handle the case where the filepath is null or undefined. Consider adding error handling for this case.
7. In `src/prompts/code-prompt.ts`, the `getTaskBreakdownPrompt` and `getCodeAgentPrompt` functions return an array of `ChatMessage`. However, there's no error handling if the input parameters are null or undefined. Consider adding error handling for these cases.
