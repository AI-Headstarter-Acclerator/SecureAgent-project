PR BOT

Inline Comments in the pr - PENDING
- files with multiple chunk headers
log files that are too large.

minimum:
get the function for the hunk and use that as general context

better:
potentially build a call chain for functions in changes
upstream -> code change -> downstream


Better prompt

Need to try catch suggestions
Convert code suggestions into a proper function call


CODE BOT

break original goal into tasks
- accomplish list of tasks
Determine when goal is achieved

Need to be able to self determine when task is done, should not be limited to 5 steps!

move to next step after editing a file

the edit function should insert NOT overwrite (this causes too many issues).
Does not take into account full context of the files, need to figure this out

relevantTask is not accurate (remove?)


how to determine when a task is achieved
- a task may take multiple steps


NOW!
Generalize to multiple repo types

Follow up with everyone on twitter + email
reach out to 10 potential users


how much of the full file is the llm actually getting
what is in the patch?


minimum: get the function context of the diff and use that as general context
