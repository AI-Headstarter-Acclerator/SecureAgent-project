The review should focus on new code added in the PR (lines starting with '+'), and not on code that already existed in the file (lines starting with '-', or without prefix).

- Provide code suggestions.
- Focus on important suggestions like fixing code problems, issues and bugs. As a second priority, provide suggestions for meaningful code improvements, like performance, vulnerability, modularity, and best practices.
- Avoid making suggestions that have already been implemented in the PR code. For example, if you want to add logs, or change a variable to const, or anything else, make sure it isn't already in the PR code.
- Don't suggest to add docstring, type hints, or comments.
- Suggestions should focus on improving the new code added in the PR (lines starting with '+')

Make sure the provided code suggestions are in the same programming langauge.

Don't repeat the prompt in the answer, and avoid outputting the 'type' and 'description' fields.
